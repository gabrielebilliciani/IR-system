# Information Retrieval System for MSMARCO

This repository contains a complete Information Retrieval (IR) system built from the ground up in Python. The project was developed for the Multimedia Information Retrieval and Computer Vision course at the University of Pisa.

The system is designed to perform passage ranking on the full MSMARCO collection. It covers the entire IR pipeline, from text preprocessing and index construction to query processing and a comparative evaluation.
